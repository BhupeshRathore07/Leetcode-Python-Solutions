# Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
# Output: false
 
# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
# s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 
# Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
