# The variance of a string is defined as the largest difference between the number of occurrences of any 2 characters present in the string. Note the two characters may or may not be the same.

# Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters only, return the largest variance possible among all substrings of s.

# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "aababbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# All possible variances along with their respective substrings are listed below:
# - Variance 0 for substrings "a", "aa", "ab", "abab", "aababb", "ba", "b", "bb", and "bbb".
# - Variance 1 for substrings "aab", "aba", "abb", "aabab", "ababb", "aababbb", and "bab".
# - Variance 2 for substrings "aaba", "ababbb", "abbb", and "babb".
# - Variance 3 for substring "babbb".
# Since the largest possible variance is 3, we return it.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "abcde"
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# No letter occurs more than once in s, so the variance of every substring is 0.
 
# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# s consists of lowercase English letters.
